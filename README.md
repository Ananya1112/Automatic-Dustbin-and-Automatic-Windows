This repository contains my one of my Home Automation robotics projects

#### Home Automation is the new field of interest of many people.
The mere pleasure of having all your work done automatically is what makes home automation so deisrable.

Under this, we have made an automatic dustbin and an automatic window.

### 1.)**Automatic Dustbin:**

    Automatic dustbin makes a normal dustbin automatic by making it open and close automatically
    upon the nearing of your hand. It uses ultrasonic sensors to accomplish this. 
    Materials you will be needing: Arduino UNO, UltraSonic sensors, Jumper Wires, Stepper Motors, etc.
        
### 2.)**Automatic Window:**
   
    Automatic Window is an attempt to make the windows of our home self reliable.
    These windows can be opened and closed conviently by an app.
    Also these windows can close themselves by sensing rain. For this they use moisture sensors.
    
    Materials used: Stepper motors, Mositure Sensor, NodeMCU ( for giving app control over wifi ).
